Let me refine my understanding based on your responses:

View Switching:


When a product is selected (new or existing), the product grid area will be replaced with options panel
Users cannot access other products until they complete the current product options
A "Done" button returns to product grid
The options panel completely takes over the product selection area for clarity and focus


Order List Display:


Selected product is highlighted
Quantity always shows next to product name
Customizations (extras/less) appear as indented lines under the product
Example visual structure:

2x Burger              $20.00
   Extra Mayo
   Less Onions
1x Fries               $5.00

Options Panel Components:
For all products:


Quantity controls (digit box, +/- buttons)
Done button to return to product grid

Product-specific options:

Options like Extra/Less for applicable ingredients
Options are predefined/hardcoded (no DB yet)
Different products will show different sets of options
Some products might only have quantity control


Workflow:


User selects product (new or from order)
Product grid switches to options panel
Quantity control is auto-selected for new products
User can modify quantity and options
Hitting "Done" saves changes and returns to product grid
Changes reflect immediately in order list with proper indentation


Data Structure (Hardcoded):


Need to define product options similar to how categories/products are defined
Each product needs its applicable options list
Options need to define if they're "Extra" or "Less" type
