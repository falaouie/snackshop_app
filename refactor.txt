Recommended Refactoring Approach

1. Standardize widget creation pattern: Use a consistent factory approach for widget creation
2. Consistent signal connection: Connect all signals at creation time or in a dedicated connection method
3. Unified naming convention: Standardize on either _on_* or _handle_* for event handlers
4. Clear state management boundaries: Define clear responsibilities between view and controller
5. Consistent error handling: Standardize error handling approach with a unified method
6. Unified styling approach: Extract all inline styles to style files
7. Consistent UI refresh pattern: Implement a standard observer pattern for UI updates

This refactoring would significantly improve code maintainability, 
make it easier to extend with new features, 
and reduce the likelihood of bugs when modifying existing functionality.
