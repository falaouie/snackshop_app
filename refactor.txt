Pending Inconsistencies for Future Refactoring
Based on our improvements to OrderListWidget and POSView, here are the remaining inconsistencies to address in future refactoring:
1. Signal Naming Conventions
Different widgets use different naming patterns for signals:

ProductGridWidget: product_selected, category_changed (past tense)
TopBarWidget: search_changed, lock_clicked (mixed tense)
TransactionButtonsWidget: action_triggered (past tense)
NumpadWidget: value_changed, value_committed (past tense)
PaymentOptionWidget: payment_requested (past tense)

Goal: Standardize all signals to use past tense verbs (e.g., clicked, selected, changed).
2. Lambda Function Usage
Several widgets still use lambdas:

ProductGridWidget: Uses lambdas for button click handling
TransactionButtonsWidget: Uses lambdas to pass button types
PresetWidgets: May use lambdas for button connections

Goal: Replace with helper methods similar to our OrderListWidget approach.
3. Widget Signal Connection Patterns
Not all widgets have a dedicated signal connection method:

ProductGridWidget: Connects signals during widget creation
NumpadWidget: Mixes UI creation with signal connections
Various payment and transaction widgets

Goal: Add _connect_signals() methods to all widget classes.
4. Handler Method Naming
There's inconsistency in handler method naming:

Some use _handle_*
Some use _on_*
Some have no prefix

Goal: Standardize on _on_* prefix across all widgets.
5. Widget Creation Hierarchy
Currently POSView has a mix of:

Direct instantiation: self.order_list = OrderListWidget()
Complex creation methods: self._create_products_widget()

Goal: Consider standardizing the widget creation pattern.
6. Event Handling Mechanisms
Different approaches to event handling:

Mouse events via lambda overrides
Signal/slot connections
Direct handling within widget classes

Goal: Move toward standard Qt signal/slot pattern for all events.
Widgets to Target First

ProductGridWidget: Has similar mouse event handling to OrderListWidget
Payment widgets: Standardize signal/slot usage
NumpadWidget: Clean up signal handling and button connections
TopBarWidget: Improve signal naming
