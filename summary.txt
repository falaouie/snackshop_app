Summary of Refactoring Achievements

Created a Centralized Size Category System:

config/size_categories.py establishes a single source of truth for screen sizes
Screen detection logic in screen_config.py now exposes the current size category


Implemented Component-Specific Configurations:

Created dedicated layout configs for numpad, search, and keyboard
Each component now has its own responsive sizing and layout logic
Configurations respond dynamically to screen size changes


Improved Styling Organization:

Moved from inline styles to dedicated styling modules
Created keyboard_styles.py for centralized keyboard styling
Component styling now uses the new configuration system


Reduced Coupling Between Components:

Components now maintain their own configuration
Keyboard and search functionality remain integrated but with cleaner boundaries
Components can now evolve independently


Maintained Backward Compatibility:

Existing components continue to work during the transition
Legacy code marked as deprecated for gradual removal
Application functionality preserved throughout the refactoring



This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while making the code
 more maintainable, modular, and responsive to different screen sizes.
