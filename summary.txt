Session Summary: Order Component Refactoring
In this session, we refactored the Order List component to use a more maintainable and responsive approach to styling and layout. Key accomplishments:

Created a Dedicated Configuration File:

Added order_layout.py with size-specific configurations for all order components
Organized configurations by screen size (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
Added comprehensive sizing parameters for panel width, margins, label sizes, etc.


Improved Styling Methodology:

Converted static style constants to configuration-driven methods
Implemented a consistent method-based approach for all styles
Made styling responsive to screen size changes


Fixed Panel Width Issues:

Identified and resolved the root cause of panel width inconsistencies
Centralized width control to a single source of truth
Added explicit size policies to work with QSplitter


Enhanced Splitter Behavior:

Made splitter handles non-interactive when appropriate
Set proper stretch factors to maintain fixed widths
Improved user experience by preventing unexpected panel resizing


Eliminated Style Duplication:

Removed duplicate style definitions between files
Created a hierarchical styling structure with proper imports
Made POSStyles reference OrderWidgetStyles for consistency


Added Complete Component Configuration:

Added sizing parameters for all UI elements (scroll areas, menus, etc.)
Made margins, spacing, and font sizes configurable
Ensured consistent styling across the entire component
