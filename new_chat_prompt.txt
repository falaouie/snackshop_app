I'm learning PyQt5 and working on refactoring my application to improve code consistency. I recently standardized my OrderListWidget by:

1. Adding a central `_connect_signals()` method
2. Moving signal connections to this method
3. Improving mouse event handling with a helper method

Now I'd like to apply similar improvements to my ProductGridWidget, which also uses lambda functions for button handling and connects signals during widget creation instead of in a dedicated method.

I'm looking for an incremental, step-by-step refactoring plan suitable for a PyQt5 beginner to:

1. Add a `_connect_signals()` method to ProductGridWidget
2. Move existing signal connections to this method
3. Replace lambda functions with cleaner approaches
4. Standardize naming conventions for handlers
5. Preserve all existing functionality

Please provide a careful, incremental approach with small testable steps.
