Step 1: First Assessment

Identify all signal connections in the current implementation
Identify lambda functions that need to be replaced
Note current naming patterns and inconsistencies

Step 2: Implement Basic _connect_signals() Method

Create a minimal implementation of _connect_signals()
Call it from __init__ like you did in OrderListWidget

Step 3: Extract Category Button Handler

Create a dedicated handler method for category button clicks
Replace lambda function with this method in _create_category_bar()

Step 4: Centralize Category Button Connections

Move category button signal connections to _connect_signals()
Store category buttons in a way that allows connecting in _connect_signals()

Step 5: Extract Product Button Handler

Create a dedicated handler method for product button clicks
Replace lambda function with this method in _populate_grid()

Step 6: Centralize Product Button Connections

Move product button signal connections to _connect_signals()
Implement a method to get all product buttons for connecting in _connect_signals()

Step 7: Standardize Method Naming

Rename handler methods to follow the _on_xxx_yyy convention
Ensure consistency with your OrderListWidget naming patterns

Step 8: Final Tests and Documentation

Test all functionality works as before
Document the new methods and approach
