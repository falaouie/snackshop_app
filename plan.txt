Current Refactoring Status & Next Steps
here's a summary of where we are and what's pending:
Completed

Service Layer Implementation:

Created payment_service.py, order_service.py, product_service.py, validation_service.py
Services contain the core business logic


Controller Pattern:

Implemented pos_controller.py as a mediator between views and services
Controller coordinates multiple services


Basic View Refactoring:

Updated POSView to use controller for most operations
Implemented UI state synchronization with service layer
Added refresh_order_display() method


Project Structure:

Reorganized into components, services, controllers, models, views structure
Applied proper separation of concerns



Pending

Remaining Hardcoded Values:

Button protection timer (500ms) needs to be moved to constants
Message box styles should be centralized


Complete Service Integration:

Some methods in POSView still directly access model data instead of using controller
_add_product_with_quantity() needs to use the controller
_find_existing_item() should use controller version


Validation Service Enhancement:

Complete integration with all input validations
Ensure consistent error handling


Code Cleanup:

Remove redundant methods that just pass through to controller
Extract common functionality to utility methods


Testing & Documentation:

Add unit tests for services and controllers
Document the new architecture and components



Important Files to Review
If needed, the following files would be most important to examine:

views/pos/pos_view.py - Main view with remaining refactoring needed
controllers/pos_controller.py - Controller implementation
services/payment_service.py, services/order_service.py - Core services
components/pos/order_list_widget.py - A key component for UI state
