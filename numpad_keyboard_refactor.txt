Phase 1: Implement Responsive Sizing In-Place
This keeps the style files where they are but updates them to use responsive sizing.
Step 1: Add Keyboard/Numpad Sizes to LayoutSizes

Add keyboard and numpad configuration parameters to each size class in layouts.py (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)
No changes to existing component files yet
Test: Verify the application still works with these additions

Step 2: Update KeyboardConfig in keyboard/styles.py

Modify KeyboardConfig to integrate with ScreenConfig
Add a method to initialize with screen configuration
Keep original static values as fallbacks
Test: Verify keyboard still works but now uses responsive sizing

Step 3: Update NumpadConfig in numpad/styles.py

Modify NumpadConfig to integrate with ScreenConfig
Add a method to initialize with screen configuration
Keep original static values as fallbacks
Test: Verify numpad still works but now uses responsive sizing

Phase 2: Test Responsive Behavior

Test the application at different screen sizes
Verify both components scale appropriately
Make adjustments to sizing values as needed
Fix any issues that arise before proceeding

Phase 3: Prepare for Migration
Now that responsive sizing works in place, prepare for the file move.
Step 1: Create Empty Style Files in styles/ Folder

Create styles/keyboard.py and styles/numpad.py as empty files
Add imports to styles/__init__.py but don't export classes yet
Test: Verify application still works with empty files

Step 2: Create Duplicate Content

Copy (don't move) content from keyboard/styles.py to styles/keyboard.py
Copy content from numpad/styles.py to styles/numpad.py
No changes to imports in component files yet
Test: Application should still work since we're not using these files yet

Phase 4: Migrate One Component at a Time
Step 1: Switch Keyboard Component

Update imports in keyboard.py to use styles.keyboard
Keep original keyboard/styles.py in place temporarily
Test: Verify keyboard component still works with new imports

Step 2: Switch Numpad Component

Update imports in numpad_widget.py to use styles.numpad
Keep original numpad/styles.py in place temporarily
Test: Verify numpad component still works with new imports

Phase 5: Cleanup

Remove original style files after confirming everything works
Update documentation
Final testing of the application
