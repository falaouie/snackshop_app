Step 1: Investigate Widget Structure

Examine the USD and LBP preset widget code to understand how the payment buttons are structured
Identify how to access or extract those buttons while leaving the preset denomination buttons in place

Step 2: Create Basic Payment Container Structure

Modify the _create_intermediate_container() method to create a dedicated payment container
Ensure all widgets remain in their horizontal arrangement
Verify the basic layout renders correctly with all five components showing

Step 3: Extract USD Payment Button

Access the USD payment button from the USD preset widget
Move it to the payment container
Maintain all event connections
Test to ensure the USD payment functionality remains intact

Step 4: Extract LBP Payment Button

Access the LBP payment button from the LBP preset widget
Move it to the payment container below the USD payment button
Maintain all event connections
Test to ensure the LBP payment functionality remains intact

Step 5: Adjust Spacing and Layout

Update spacing and margins for visual consistency
Ensure all buttons are properly sized in the payment container
Verify the entire layout renders correctly

Step 6: Final Testing

Test the complete payment flow using both USD and LBP buttons
Verify currency mode locking works correctly
Test responsiveness at different window sizes
