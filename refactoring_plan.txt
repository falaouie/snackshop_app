Refactoring Plan
Phase 1: Create a Service Layer and Base Infrastructure

Create a ServiceLocator pattern

Implement a simple service locator to decouple components
Define interfaces for services
Register concrete implementations at application startup


Create PaymentService

Move payment processing logic from the view to this service
Handle currency calculations and different payment types
Use enums consistently for payment types


Create OrderService

Move order management logic from OrderListWidget
Implement methods for adding, updating, removing items
Handle order state management


Define Constants and Configuration

Create a central configuration module
Move hardcoded values (like exchange rate) to configuration



Phase 2: Refactor POSView Class

Split POSView into smaller components

Create a controller class to handle business logic
Make POSView focus solely on UI concerns
Use delegation pattern to connect UI events to controller actions


Replace hardcoded literals with enum values

Replace 'CASH_LBP' with PaymentButtonType.CASH_LBP.value
Ensure consistent use of enums throughout the codebase


Extract validation logic

Create dedicated validators for different input types
Consistently apply validation rules across the application


Implement event-driven communication

Replace direct coupling with event-based communication
Consider a mediator pattern for component communication



Phase 3: Refine Component Interactions

Improve signal/slot connections

Make components completely decoupled from each other
Connect all signals at the controller level


Create view models

Add view models to transform data models for presentation
Handle UI-specific logic in view models


Implement state management

Create a state management solution for complex UI states
Ensure consistent state handling across the application



Phase 4: Add Extensibility

Prepare for database integration

Create repository interfaces
Add in-memory implementations for now
Design for future database implementation


Implement plugin architecture

Create extension points for future features
Make components replaceable and extensible



Detailed Implementation Plan for Phase 1
Let's start with Phase 1, which will give us the foundation for further refactoring without requiring a massive rewrite:
Step 1: Create a Service Locator
Create a new file core/service_locator.py:

Implement a simple registry for services
Allow services to be registered and retrieved by type

Step 2: Define Service Interfaces
Create a new directory services/interfaces/ with these files:

payment_service.py - Define PaymentService interface
order_service.py - Define OrderService interface
product_service.py - Define ProductService interface

Step 3: Implement Concrete Services
Create implementations in services/implementations/:

memory_payment_service.py - Handle payment calculations and processing
memory_order_service.py - Handle order management
memory_product_service.py - Provide product data from current hardcoded values

Step 4: Create Configuration Manager
Create config/app_config.py:

Move exchange rate to configuration
Define configuration categories (POS, UI, Business)
Provide defaults and override capability

Step 5: Refactor POSView to Use Services
Modify pos_view.py:

Inject services through constructor
Replace direct access to PRODUCT_PRICES with ProductService
Replace direct payment handling with PaymentService
Replace order list manipulation with OrderService
